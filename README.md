# signature-detection-with-neural-network

This smart signature detection machine detect is the signature copied or originally done by the exact person. it detects the accuracy of the signature according to the actual signature which is done by owner and saved in database. if the signature has accuracy is higher than 95% then only the signature is original and otherwise it will be taken as a fake or copied signature. This system is developed for banks where signature is still a import thing for authentication.
